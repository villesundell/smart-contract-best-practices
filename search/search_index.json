            "text": "Ethereum and complex blockchain programs are new and highly experimental. Therefore, you should expect constant changes in the security landscape, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new best practices are developed. Following the security practices in this document is therefore only the beginning of the security work you will need to do as a smart contract developer.\n\n\nSmart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than you may be used to. The cost of failure can be high, and change can be difficult, making it in some ways more similar to hardware programming or financial services programming than web or mobile development. It is therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities. Instead, you will need to learn a new philosophy of development:\n\n\nPrepare for failure\n\u00b6\n\n\nAny non-trivial contract will have errors in it.

The general recommendation for any smart contract system is to identify the proper balance for these fundamental tradeoffs.\n\n\nAn ideal smart contract system from a software engineering bias is modular, reuses code instead of duplicating it, and supports upgradeable components.  An ideal smart contract system from a secure architecture bias may share this mindset, especially in the case of more complex smart contract systems.\n\n\nHowever, there are important exceptions where security and software engineering best practices may not be aligned.  In each case, the proper balance is obtained by identifying the optimal mix of properties along contract system dimensions such as:\n\n\n\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\n\n\nMonolithic versus Modular\n\n\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\n\n\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhile multiple resources, including this one, emphasize malleability characteristics such as Killable, Upgradeable or Modifiable patterns there is a \nfundamental tradeoff\n between malleability and security.\n\n\nMalleability patterns by definition add complexity and potential attack surfaces.  Simplicity is particularly effective over complexity in cases where the smart contract system performs a very limited set of functionality for a pre-defined limited period of time, for example, a governance-free finite-time-frame token-sale contract system.\n\n\nMonolithic versus Modular\n\u00b6\n\n\nA monolithic self-contained contract keeps all knowledge locally identifiable and readable.  While there are few smart contract systems held in high regard that exist as monoliths, there is an argument to be made for extreme locality of data and flow - for example, in the case of optimizing code review efficiency.\n\n\nAs with the other tradeoffs considered here, security best practices trend away from software engineering best practices in simple short-lived contracts and trend toward software engineering best practices in the case of more complex perpetual contract systems.\n\n\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\u00b6\n\n\nA smart contract system from a software engineering perspective wishes to maximize reuse where reasonable.  There are many ways to reuse contract code in Solidity.  Using proven previously-deployed contracts \nwhich you own\n is generally the safest manner to achieve code reuse.\n\n\nDuplication is frequently relied upon in cases where self-owned previously-deployed contracts are not available.  Efforts such as \nZeppelin Solidity\n seek to provide patterns such that secure code can be re-used without duplication.  Any contract security analyses must include any re-used code that has not previously established a level of trust commensurate with the funds at risk in the target smart contract system.",

            "text": "This page demonstrates a number of solidity patterns which should generally be followed when writing smart contracts.\n\n\nProtocol specific recommendations\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe following recommendations apply to the development of any contract system on Ethereum.\n\n\nExternal Calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nUse caution when making external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nCalls to untrusted contracts can introduce several unexpected risks or errors. External calls may execute malicious code in that contract \nor\n any other contract that it depends upon. As such, every external call should be treated as a potential security risk. When it is not possible, or undesirable to remove external calls, use the recommendations in the rest of this section to minimize the danger.\n\n\n\n\nMark untrusted contracts\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen interacting with external contracts, name your variables, methods, and contract interfaces in a way that makes it clear that interacting with them is potentially unsafe. This applies to your own functions that call external contracts.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\n100\n);\n \n// Unclear whether trusted or untrusted\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nmakeWithdrawal\n(\nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n \n// Isn't clear that this function is potentially unsafe\n\n    \nBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\namount\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nUntrustedBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\n100\n);\n \n// untrusted external call\n\n\nTrustedBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\n100\n);\n \n// external but trusted bank contract maintained by XYZ Corp\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nmakeUntrustedWithdrawal\n(\nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nUntrustedBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\namount\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid state changes after external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhether using \nraw calls\n (of the form \nsomeAddress.call()\n) or \ncontract calls\n (of the form \nExternalContract.someMethod()\n), assume that malicious code might execute. Even if \nExternalContract\n is not malicious, malicious code can be executed by any contracts \nit\n calls.\n\n\nOne particular danger is malicious code may hijack the control flow, leading to vulnerabilities due to reentrancy. (See \nReentrancy\n for a fuller discussion of this problem).\n\n\nIf you are making a call to an untrusted external contract, \navoid state changes after the call\n. This pattern is also sometimes known as the \nchecks-effects-interactions pattern\n.\n\n\n\n\nAvoid \ntransfer()\n and \nsend()\n.\n\u00b6\n\n\n.transfer()\n and \n.send()\n forward exactly 2,300 gas to the recipient. The goal of this hardcoded gas stipend was to prevent \nreentrancy vulnerabilities\n, but this only makes sense under the assumption that gas costs are constant. Recently \nEIP 1283\n (backed out of the Constantinople hard fork at the last minute) and \nEIP 1884\n (expected to arrive in the Istanbul hard fork) have shown this assumption to be invalid.\n\n\nTo avoid things breaking when gas costs change in the future, it's best to use \n.call.value(amount)(\"\")\n instead. Note that this does nothing to mitigate reentrancy attacks, so other precautions must be taken.\n\n\n\n\nHandle errors in external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nSolidity offers low-level call methods that work on raw addresses: \naddress.call()\n, \naddress.callcode()\n, \naddress.delegatecall()\n, and \naddress.send()\n. These low-level methods never throw an exception, but will return \nfalse\n if the call encounters an exception. On the other hand, \ncontract calls\n (e.g., \nExternalContract.doSomething()\n) will automatically propagate a throw (for example, \nExternalContract.doSomething()\n will also \nthrow\n if \ndoSomething()\n throws).\n\n\nIf you choose to use the low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail, by checking the return value.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\nsend\n(\n55\n);\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n55\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n \n// this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn't check for result\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n100\n)(\nbytes4\n(\nsha3\n(\n\"deposit()\"\n)));\n \n// if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n55\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n\nif\n(\n!\nsuccess\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n// handle failure code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nExternalContract\n(\nsomeAddress\n).\ndeposit\n.\nvalue\n(\n100\n)();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor \npull\n over \npush\n for external calls\n\u00b6\n\n\nExternal calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically. (This also reduces the chance of \nproblems with the gas limit\n.)  Avoid combining multiple ether transfers in a single transaction.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\ncontract\n \nauction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nhighestBidder\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n>=\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nhighestBidder\n \n!=\n \naddress\n(\n0\n))\n \n{\n\n            \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nhighestBidder\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\nhighestBid\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n            \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n \n// if this call consistently fails, no one else can bid\n\n        \n}\n\n\n       \nhighestBidder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n       \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\ncontract\n \nauction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nhighestBidder\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nrefunds\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n>=\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nhighestBidder\n \n!=\n \naddress\n(\n0\n))\n \n{\n\n            \nrefunds\n[\nhighestBidder\n]\n \n+=\n \nhighestBid\n;\n \n// record the refund that this user can claim\n\n        \n}\n\n\n        \nhighestBidder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n        \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nwithdrawRefund\n()\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \nrefund\n \n=\n \nrefunds\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n        \nrefunds\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n        \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\nrefund\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't delegatecall to untrusted code\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \ndelegatecall\n function is used to call functions from other contracts as if they belong to the caller contract. Thus the callee may change the state of the calling address. This may be insecure. An example below shows how using \ndelegatecall\n can lead to the destruction of the contract and loss of its balance.\n\n\ncontract\n \nDestructor\n\n\n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \ndoWork\n()\n \nexternal\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nselfdestruct\n(\n0\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nWorker\n\n\n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \ndoWork\n(\naddress\n \n_internalWorker\n)\n \npublic\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n// unsafe\n\n        \n_internalWorker\n.\ndelegatecall\n(\nbytes4\n(\nkeccak256\n(\n\"doWork()\"\n)));\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \nWorker.doWork()\n is called with the address of the deployed \nDestructor\n contract as an argument, the \nWorker\n contract will self-destruct. Delegate execution only to trusted contracts, and \nnever to a user supplied address\n.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDon't assume contracts are created with zero balance\n  An attacker can send ether to the address of a contract before it is created.  Contracts should not assume that its initial state contains a zero balance.  See \nissue 61\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that Ether can be forcibly sent to an account\n\u00b6\n\n\nBeware of coding an invariant that strictly checks the balance of a contract.\n\n\nAn attacker can forcibly send ether to any account and this cannot be prevented (not even with a fallback function that does a \nrevert()\n).\n\n\nThe attacker can do this by creating a contract, funding it with 1 wei, and invoking\n\nselfdestruct(victimAddress)\n.  No code is invoked in \nvictimAddress\n, so it\ncannot be prevented. This is also true for\n\n\n\n\nRemember that on-chain data is public\n\u00b6\n\n\nMany applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid \nVickrey auctions\n) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, make sure you avoid requiring users to publish information too early. The best strategy is to use \ncommitment schemes\n with separate phases: first commit using the hash of the values and in a later phase revealing the values.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nIn rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.\n\n\nIn an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their auction bid value in the second phase.\n\n\nWhen developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be \n(1)\n players submit moves, \n(2)\n random number generated, \n(3)\n players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through \nhttp://btcrelay.org\n), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and \nRANDAO\n. As Ethereum is a deterministic protocol, no variable within the protocol could be used as an unpredictable random number. Also be aware that miners are in some extent in control of the \nblock.blockhash()\n value\n*\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware of the possibility that some participants may \"drop offline\" and not return\n\u00b6\n\n\nDo not make refund or claim processes dependent on a specific party performing a particular action with no other way of getting the funds out. For example, in a rock-paper-scissors game, one common mistake is to not make a payout until both players submit their moves; however, a malicious player can \"grief\" the other by simply never submitting their move - in fact, if a player sees the other player's revealed move and determines that they lost, they have no reason to submit their own move at all. This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.\n\n\n\n\nBeware of negation of the most negative signed integer\n\u00b6\n\n\nSolidity provides several types to work with signed integers. Like in most programming languages, in Solidity a signed integer with \nN\n bits can represent values from \n-2^(N-1)\n to \n2^(N-1)-1\n. This means that there is no positive equivalent for the \nMIN_INT\n. Negation is implemented as finding the two's complement of a number, so the negation of the most negative number \nwill result in the same number\n.\n\n\nThis is true for all signed integer types in Solidity (\nint8\n, \nint16\n, ..., \nint256\n).\n\n\ncontract\n \nNegation\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \nnegate8\n(\nint8\n \n_i\n)\n \npublic\n \npure\n \nreturns\n(\nint8\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \n-\n_i\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nnegate16\n(\nint16\n \n_i\n)\n \npublic\n \npure\n \nreturns\n(\nint16\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \n-\n_i\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nint8\n \npublic\n \na\n \n=\n \nnegate8\n(\n-\n128\n);\n \n// -128\n\n    \nint16\n \npublic\n \nb\n \n=\n \nnegate16\n(\n-\n128\n);\n \n// 128\n\n    \nint16\n \npublic\n \nc\n \n=\n \nnegate16\n(\n-\n32768\n);\n \n// -32768\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to handle this is to check the value of a variable before negation and throw if it's equal to the \nMIN_INT\n. Another option is to make sure that the most negative number will never be achieved by using a type with a higher capacity (e.g. \nint32\n instead of \nint16\n).\n\n\nA similar issue with \nint\n types occurs when \nMIN_INT\n is multiplied or divided by \n-1\n.\n\n\n\n\nSolidity specific recommendations\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe following recommendations are specific to Solidity, but may also be instructive for developing smart contracts in other languages.\n\n\nEnforce invariants with \nassert()\n\u00b6\n\n\nAn assert guard triggers when an assertion fails - such as an invariant property changing. For example, the token to ether issuance ratio, in a token issuance contract, may be fixed. You can verify that this is the case at all times with an \nassert()\n. Assert guards should often be combined with other techniques, such as pausing the contract and allowing upgrades. (Otherwise, you may end up stuck, with an assertion that is always failing.)\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract\n \nToken\n \n{\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \npublic\n \nbalanceOf\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \npublic\n \ntotalSupply\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npublic\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n        \ntotalSupply\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n        \nassert\n(\nthis\n.\nbalance\n \n>=\n \ntotalSupply\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the assertion is \nnot\n a strict equality of the balance because the contract can be \nforcibly sent ether\n without going through the \ndeposit()\n function!\n\n\n\n\nUse \nassert()\n, \nrequire()\n, \nrevert()\n properly\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nThe convenience functions \nassert\n and \nrequire\n can be used to check for conditions and throw an exception if the condition is not met.\n\n\nThe \nassert\n function should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants.\n\n\nThe \nrequire\n function should be used to ensure valid conditions, such as inputs, or contract state variables are met, or to validate return values from calls to external contracts. \n*\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this paradigm allows formal analysis tools to verify that the invalid opcode can never be reached: meaning no invariants in the code are violated and that the code is formally verified.\n\n\npragma solidity\n \n^\n0\n.\n5\n.\n0\n;\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nSharer\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsendHalf\n(\naddress\n \npayable\n \naddr\n)\n \npublic\n \npayable\n \nreturns\n \n(\nuint\n \nbalance\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n%\n \n2\n \n==\n \n0\n,\n \n\"Even value required.\"\n);\n \n//Require() can have an optional message string\n\n        \nuint\n \nbalanceBeforeTransfer\n \n=\n \naddress\n(\nthis\n).\nbalance\n;\n\n        \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \naddr\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n/\n \n2\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n        \n// Since we reverted if the transfer failed, there should be\n\n        \n// no way for us to still have half of the money.\n\n        \nassert\n(\naddress\n(\nthis\n).\nbalance\n \n==\n \nbalanceBeforeTransfer\n \n-\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n/\n \n2\n);\n \n// used for internal error checking\n\n        \nreturn\n \naddress\n(\nthis\n).\nbalance\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse modifiers only for assertions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe code inside a modifier is usually executed before the function body, so any state changes or external calls will violate the \nChecks-Effects-Interactions\n pattern. Moreover, these statements may also remain unnoticed by the developer, as the code for modifier may be far from the function declaration. For example, an external call in modifier can lead to the reentrancy attack:\n\n\ncontract\n \nRegistry\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nisVoter\n(\naddress\n \n_addr\n)\n \nexternal\n \nreturns\n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n        \n// Code\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nElection\n \n{\n\n    \nRegistry\n \nregistry\n;\n\n\n    \nmodifier\n \nisEligible\n(\naddress\n \n_addr\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nregistry\n.\nisVoter\n(\n_addr\n));\n\n        \n_\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nvote\n()\n \nisEligible\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \n// Code\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the \nRegistry\n contract can make a reentracy attack by calling \nElection.vote()\n inside \nisVoter()\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nUse \nmodifiers\n to replace duplicate condition checks in multiple functions, such as \nisOwner()\n, otherwise use \nrequire\n or \nrevert\n inside the function.

Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical. Although, interfaces are certainly useful for designing contracts prior to implementation. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that if a contract inherits from an abstract contract it must implement all non-implemented functions via overriding or it will be abstract as well.\n\n\n\n\nFallback Functions\n\u00b6\n\n\nKeep fallback functions simple\n\u00b6\n\n\nFallback functions\n are called when a contract is sent a message with no arguments (or when no function matches), and only has access to 2,300 gas when called from a \n.send()\n or \n.transfer()\n. If you wish to be able to receive Ether from a \n.send()\n or \n.transfer()\n, the most you can do in a fallback function is log an event. Use a proper function if a computation of more gas is required.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npayable\n \nexternal\n \n{\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\ndata\n.\nlength\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n \nemit\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck data length in fallback functions\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince the \nfallback functions\n is not only called for plain ether transfers (without data) but also when no other function matches, you should check that the data is empty if the fallback function is intended to be used only for the purpose of logging received Ether. Otherwise, callers will not notice if your contract is used incorrectly and functions that do not exist are called.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nemit\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\ndata\n.\nlength\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n \nemit\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicitly mark payable functions and state variables\n\u00b6\n\n\nStarting from Solidity \n0.4.0\n, every function that is receiving ether must use \npayable\n modifier, otherwise if the transaction has \nmsg.value > 0\n will revert (\nexcept when forced\n).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSomething that might not be obvious: The \npayable\n modifier only applies to calls from \nexternal\n contracts. If I call a non-payable function in the payable function in the same contract, the non-payable function won't fail, though \nmsg.value\n is still set\n\n\n\n\nExplicitly mark visibility in functions and state variables\n\u00b6\n\n\nExplicitly label the visibility of functions and state variables. Functions can be specified as being \nexternal\n, \npublic\n, \ninternal\n or \nprivate\n. Please understand the differences between them, for example, \nexternal\n may be sufficient instead of \npublic\n. For state variables, \nexternal\n is not possible. Labeling the visibility explicitly will make it easier to catch incorrect assumptions about who can call the function or access the variable.\n\n\n\n\nExternal\n functions are part of the contract interface. An external function \nf\n cannot be called internally (i.e. \nf()\n does not work, but \nthis.f()\n works). External functions are sometimes more efficient when they receive large arrays of data.\n\n\nPublic\n functions are part of the contract interface and can be either called internally or via messages. For public state variables, an automatic getter function (see below) is generated.\n\n\nInternal\n functions and state variables can only be accessed internally, without using \nthis\n.\n\n\nPrivate\n functions and state variables are only visible for the contract they are defined in and not in derived contracts. \nNote\n: Everything that is inside a contract is visible to all observers external to the blockchain, even \nPrivate\n variables.\n*\n\n\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nuint\n \nx\n;\n \n// the default is internal for state variables, but it should be made explicit\n\n\nfunction\n \nbuy\n()\n \n{\n \n// the default is public\n\n    \n// public code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nuint\n \nprivate\n \ny\n;\n\n\nfunction\n \nbuy\n()\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n    \n// only callable externally or using this.buy()\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nutility\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// callable externally, as well as internally: changing this code requires thinking about both cases.\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ninternalAction\n()\n \ninternal\n \n{\n\n    \n// internal code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLock pragmas to specific compiler version\n\u00b6\n\n\nContracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested the most with. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs. Contracts may also be deployed by others and the pragma indicates the compiler version intended by the original authors.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\npragma solidity\n \n^\n0\n.\n4\n.\n4\n;\n\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\npragma solidity\n \n0\n.\n4\n.\n4\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: a floating pragma version (ie. \n^0.4.25\n) will compile fine with \n0.4.26-nightly.2018.9.25\n, however nightly builds should never be used to compile code for production.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nPragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse events to monitor contract activity\n\u00b6\n\n\nIt can be useful to have a way to monitor the contract's activity after it was deployed. One way to accomplish this is to look at all transactions of the contract, however that may be insufficient, as message calls between contracts are not recorded in the blockchain. Moreover, it shows only the input parameters, not the actual changes being made to the state. Also events could be used to trigger functions in the user interface.\n\n\ncontract\n \nCharity\n \n{\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nbalances\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \ndonate\n()\n \npayable\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nGame\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbuyCoins\n()\n \npayable\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \n// 5% goes to charity\n\n        \ncharity\n.\ndonate\n.\nvalue\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n/\n \n20\n)();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \nGame\n contract will make an internal call to \nCharity.donate()\n.

In a sale spanning days, the 15-second rule allows one to achieve a more reliable estimate of time.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Inheritance Caution\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen utilizing multiple inheritance in Solidity, it is important to understand how the compiler composes the inheritance graph.\n\n\ncontract\n \nFinal\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \npublic\n \na\n;\n\n    \nfunction\n \nFinal\n(\nuint\n \nf\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \na\n \n=\n \nf\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nB\n \nis\n \nFinal\n \n{\n\n    \nint\n \npublic\n \nfee\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nB\n(\nuint\n \nf\n)\n \nFinal\n(\nf\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsetFee\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \nfee\n \n=\n \n3\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nC\n \nis\n \nFinal\n \n{\n\n    \nint\n \npublic\n \nfee\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nC\n(\nuint\n \nf\n)\n \nFinal\n(\nf\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsetFee\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \nfee\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nA\n \nis\n \nB\n,\n \nC\n \n{\n\n  \nfunction\n \nA\n()\n \npublic\n \nB\n(\n3\n)\n \nC\n(\n5\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nsetFee\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nWhen a contract is deployed, the compiler will \nlinearize\n the inheritance from right to left (after the keyword \nis\n the parents are listed from the most base-like to the most derived). Here is contract A's linearization:\n\n\nFinal <- B <- C <- A\n\n\nThe consequence of the linearization will yield a \nfee\n value of 5, since C is the most derived contract. This may seem obvious, but imagine scenarios where C is able to shadow crucial functions, reorder boolean clauses, and cause the developer to write exploitable contracts. Static analysis currently does not raise issue with overshadowed functions, so it must be manually inspected.\n\n\nFor more on security and inheritance, check out this \narticle\n\n\nTo help contribute, Solidity's Github has a \nproject\n with all inheritance-related issues.\n\n\n\n\nUse interface type instead of the address for type safety\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen a function takes a contract address as an argument, it is better to pass an interface or contract type rather than raw \naddress\n. If the function is called elsewhere within the source code, the compiler it will provide additional type safety guarantees.\n\n\nHere we see two alternatives:\n\n\ncontract\n \nValidator\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \nvalidate\n(\nuint\n)\n \nexternal\n \nreturns\n(\nbool\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nTypeSafeAuction\n \n{\n\n    \n// good\n\n    \nfunction\n \nvalidateBet\n(\nValidator\n \n_validator\n,\n \nuint\n \n_value\n)\n \ninternal\n \nreturns\n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nbool\n \nvalid\n \n=\n \n_validator\n.\nvalidate\n(\n_value\n);\n\n        \nreturn\n \nvalid\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nTypeUnsafeAuction\n \n{\n\n    \n// bad\n\n    \nfunction\n \nvalidateBet\n(\naddress\n \n_addr\n,\n \nuint\n \n_value\n)\n \ninternal\n \nreturns\n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nValidator\n \nvalidator\n \n=\n \nValidator\n(\n_addr\n);\n\n        \nbool\n \nvalid\n \n=\n \nvalidator\n.\nvalidate\n(\n_value\n);\n\n        \nreturn\n \nvalid\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of using the \nTypeSafeAuction\n contract above can then be seen from the following example. If \nvalidateBet()\n is called with an \naddress\n argument, or a contract type other than \nValidator\n, the compiler will throw this error:\n\n\ncontract\n \nNonValidator\n{}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nAuction\n \nis\n \nTypeSafeAuction\n \n{\n\n    \nNonValidator\n \nnonValidator\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbet\n(\nuint\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nbool\n \nvalid\n \n=\n \nvalidateBet\n(\nnonValidator\n,\n \n_value\n);\n \n// TypeError: Invalid type for argument in function call.\n\n                                                        \n// Invalid implicit conversion from contract NonValidator\n\n                                                        \n// to contract Validator requested.\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid using \nextcodesize\n to check for Externally Owned Accounts\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe following modifier (or a similar check) is often used to verify whether a call was made from an externally owned account (EOA) or a contract account:\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nmodifier\n \nisNotContract\n(\naddress\n \n_a\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nuint\n \nsize\n;\n\n  \nassembly\n \n{\n\n    \nsize\n \n:=\n \nextcodesize\n(\n_a\n)\n\n  \n}\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nsize\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n;\n\n     \n_\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is straight forward: if an address contains code, it's not an EOA but a contract account. However, \na contract does not have source code available during construction\n. This means that while the constructor is running, it can make calls to other contracts, but \nextcodesize\n for its address returns zero. Below is a minimal example that shows how this check can be circumvented:\n\n\ncontract\n \nOnlyForEOA\n \n{\n    \n    \nuint\n \npublic\n \nflag\n;\n\n\n    \n// bad\n\n    \nmodifier\n \nisNotContract\n(\naddress\n \n_a\n){\n\n        \nuint\n \nlen\n;\n\n        \nassembly\n \n{\n \nlen\n \n:=\n \nextcodesize\n(\n_a\n)\n \n}\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nlen\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n;\n\n        \n_\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsetFlag\n(\nuint\n \ni\n)\n \npublic\n \nisNotContract\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n){\n\n        \nflag\n \n=\n \ni\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nFakeEOA\n \n{\n\n    \nconstructor\n(\naddress\n \n_a\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \nOnlyForEOA\n \nc\n \n=\n \nOnlyForEOA\n(\n_a\n);\n\n        \nc\n.\nsetFlag\n(\n1\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause contract addresses can be pre-computed, this check could also fail if it checks an address which is empty at block \nn\n, but which has a contract deployed to it at some block greater than \nn\n.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis issue is nuanced.\n\n\nIf your goal is to prevent other contracts from being able to call your contract, the \nextcodesize\n check is probably sufficient. An alternative approach is to check the value of \n(tx.origin == msg.sender)\n, though this also \nhas drawbacks\n.\n\n\nThere may be other situations in which the \nextcodesize\n check serves your purpose. Describing all of them here is out of scope. Understand the underlying behaviors of the EVM and use your Judgement.\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated/historical recommendations\n\u00b6\n\n\nThese are recommendations which are no longer relevant due to changes in the protocol or improvements to solidity. They are recorded here for posterity and awareness.\n\n\nBeware division by zero (Solidity < 0.4)\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrior to version 0.4, Solidity \nreturns zero\n and does not \nthrow\n an exception when a number is divided by zero.

Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid  Vickrey auctions ) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, make sure you avoid requiring users to publish information too early. The best strategy is to use  commitment schemes  with separate phases: first commit using the hash of the values and in a later phase revealing the values.  Examples:   In rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.  In an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their auction bid value in the second phase.  When developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be  (1)  players submit moves,  (2)  random number generated,  (3)  players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through  http://btcrelay.org ), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and  RANDAO .

However,  a contract does not have source code available during construction . This means that while the constructor is running, it can make calls to other contracts, but  extcodesize  for its address returns zero. Below is a minimal example that shows how this check can be circumvented:  contract   OnlyForEOA   {     \n     uint   public   flag ; \n\n     // bad \n     modifier   isNotContract ( address   _a ){ \n         uint   len ; \n         assembly   {   len   :=   extcodesize ( _a )   } \n         require ( len   ==   0 ) ; \n         _ ; \n     } \n\n     function   setFlag ( uint   i )   public   isNotContract ( msg . sender ){ \n         flag   =   i ; \n     }  }  contract   FakeEOA   { \n     constructor ( address   _a )   public   { \n         OnlyForEOA   c   =   OnlyForEOA ( _a ); \n         c . setFlag ( 1 ); \n     }  }   Because contract addresses can be pre-computed, this check could also fail if it checks an address which is empty at block  n , but which has a contract deployed to it at some block greater than  n .   Warning  This issue is nuanced.  If your goal is to prevent other contracts from being able to call your contract, the  extcodesize  check is probably sufficient.

This class of bug can take many forms, and both of the major bugs that led to the DAO's collapse were bugs of this sort.\n\n\nReentrancy on a Single Function\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first version of this bug to be noticed involved functions that could be called repeatedly, before the first invocation of the function was finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in destructive ways.\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n \n// At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the user's balance is not set to 0 until the very end of the function, the second (and later) invocations will still succeed, and will withdraw the balance over and over again.\n\n\n\n\nFactoid\n\n\nA DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Its goal is to codify the rules and decisionmaking apparatus of an organization, eliminating the need for documents and people in governing, creating a structure with decentralized control.\n\n\nOn June 17\nth\n 2016, \nThe DAO\n was hacked and 3.6 million Ether ($50 Million) were stolen using the first reentrancy attack.\n\n\nEthereum Foundation issued a critical update to rollback the hack. This resulted in Ethereum being forked into Ethereum Classic and Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\nIn the example given, the best way to prevent this attack is to make sure you don't call an external function until you've done all the internal work you need to do:\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n \n// The user's balance is already 0, so future invocations won't withdraw anything\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you had another function which called \nwithdrawBalance()\n, it would be potentially subject to the same attack, so you must treat any function which calls an untrusted contract as itself untrusted. See below for further discussion of potential solutions.\n\n\nCross-function Reentrancy\n\u00b6\n\n\nAn attacker may also be able to do a similar attack using two different functions that share the same state.\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \nto\n,\n \nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n       \nuserBalances\n[\nto\n]\n \n+=\n \namount\n;\n\n       \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \namount\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n \n// At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call transfer()\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the attacker calls \ntransfer()\n when their code is executed on the external call in \nwithdrawBalance\n. Since their balance has not yet been set to 0, they are able to transfer the tokens even though they already received the withdrawal. This vulnerability was also used in the DAO attack.\n\n\nThe same solutions will work, with the same caveats. Also note that in this example, both functions were part of the same contract. However, the same bug can occur across multiple contracts, if those contracts share state.\n\n\nPitfalls in Reentrancy Solutions\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince reentrancy can occur across multiple functions, and even multiple contracts, any solution aimed at preventing reentrancy with a single function will not be sufficient.\n\n\nInstead, \nwe have recommended finishing all internal work (ie. state changes) first, and only then calling the external function\n. This rule, if followed carefully, will allow you to avoid vulnerabilities due to reentrancy. However, you need to not only avoid calling external functions too soon, but also avoid calling functions which call external functions. For example, the following is insecure:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nbool\n)\n \nprivate\n \nclaimedBonus\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nrewardsForA\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawReward\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n];\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nrecipient\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ngetFirstWithdrawalBonus\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]);\n \n// Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once\n\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n+=\n \n100\n;\n\n    \nwithdrawReward\n(\nrecipient\n);\n \n// At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.\n\n    \nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though \ngetFirstWithdrawalBonus()\n doesn't directly call an external contract, the call in \nwithdrawReward()\n is enough to make it vulnerable to a reentrancy. You therefore need to treat \nwithdrawReward()\n as if it were also untrusted.\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nbool\n)\n \nprivate\n \nclaimedBonus\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nrewardsForA\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nuntrustedWithdrawReward\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n];\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nrecipient\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nsuccess\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nuntrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]);\n \n// Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once\n\n\n    \nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n+=\n \n100\n;\n\n    \nuntrustedWithdrawReward\n(\nrecipient\n);\n \n// claimedBonus has been set to true, so reentry is impossible\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the fix making reentry impossible, \nuntrusted functions have been marked\n. This same pattern repeats at every level: since \nuntrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()\n calls \nuntrustedWithdrawReward()\n, which calls an external contract, you must also treat \nuntrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()\n as insecure.\n\n\nAnother solution often suggested is a \nmutex\n. This allows you to \"lock\" some state so it can only be changed by the owner of the lock. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\n// Note: This is a rudimentary example, and mutexes are particularly useful where there is substantial logic and/or shared state\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nbalances\n;\n\n\nbool\n \nprivate\n \nlockBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npayable\n \npublic\n \nreturns\n \n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nlockBalances\n);\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n(\nuint\n \namount\n)\n \npayable\n \npublic\n \nreturns\n \n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nlockBalances\n \n&&\n \namount\n \n>\n \n0\n \n&&\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \namount\n);\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n    \n(\nbool\n \nsuccess\n,\n \n)\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n(\namount\n)(\n\"\"\n);\n\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nsuccess\n)\n \n{\n \n// Normally insecure, but the mutex saves it\n\n      \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \namount\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user tries to call \nwithdraw()\n again before the first call finishes, the lock will prevent it from having any effect. This can be an effective pattern, but it gets tricky when you have multiple contracts that need to cooperate. The following is insecure:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\ncontract\n \nStateHolder\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \nprivate\n \nn\n;\n\n    \naddress\n \nprivate\n \nlockHolder\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \ngetLock\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nlockHolder\n \n==\n \naddress\n(\n0\n));\n\n        \nlockHolder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nreleaseLock\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nlockHolder\n);\n\n        \nlockHolder\n \n=\n \naddress\n(\n0\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nset\n(\nuint\n \nnewState\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nlockHolder\n);\n\n        \nn\n \n=\n \nnewState\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can call \ngetLock()\n, and then never call \nreleaseLock()\n. If they do this, then the contract will be locked forever, and no further changes will be able to be made. If you use mutexes to protect against reentrancy, you will need to carefully ensure that there are no ways for a lock to be claimed and never released. (There are other potential dangers when programming with mutexes, such as deadlocks and livelocks. You should consult the large amount of literature already written on mutexes, if you decide to go this route.)\n\n\n\n\nFront-Running (AKA Transaction-Ordering Dependence)\n\u00b6\n\n\nAbove were examples of reentrancy involving the attacker executing malicious code \nwithin a single transaction\n. The following are a different type of attack inherent to Blockchains: the fact that \nthe order of transactions themselves\n (e.g. within a block) is easily subject to manipulation.\n\n\nSince a transaction is in the mempool for a short while, one can know what actions will occur before it is included in a block. This can be troublesome for things like decentralized markets, where a transaction to buy some tokens can be seen, and a market order implemented before the other transaction gets included. Protecting against this is difficult, as it would come down to the specific contract itself. For example, in markets, it would be better to implement batch auctions (this also protects against high frequency trading concerns). Another way to use a pre-commit scheme (\u201cI\u2019m going to submit the details later\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nTimestamp Dependence\n\u00b6\n\n\nBe aware that the timestamp of the block can be manipulated by the miner, and all direct and indirect uses of the timestamp should be considered.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSee the \nRecommendations\n section for design considerations related to Timestamp Dependence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteger Overflow and Underflow\n\u00b6\n\n\nConsider a simple token transfer:\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint256\n)\n \npublic\n \nbalanceOf\n;\n\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \n_to\n,\n \nuint256\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n/* Check if sender has balance */\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \n_value\n);\n\n    \n/* Add and subtract new balances */\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \n_value\n;\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+=\n \n_value\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// SECURE\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \n_to\n,\n \nuint256\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n/* Check if sender has balance and for overflows */\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>=\n \n_value\n \n&&\n \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+\n \n_value\n \n>=\n \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]);\n\n\n    \n/* Add and subtract new balances */\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \n_value\n;\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+=\n \n_value\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a balance reaches the \nmaximum uint value (2^256)\n it will circle back to zero which checks for the condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the \nuint\n value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the \nuint\n variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the \nuint\n value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.\n\n\nThe same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.\n\n\nBe careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBe aware there are around \n20 cases for overflow and underflow\n.\n\n\n\n\nOne simple solution to mitigate the common mistakes for overflow and underflow is to use \nSafeMath.sol\n \nlibrary\n for arithmetic functions.\n\n\nUnderflow in Depth: Storage Manipulation\n\u00b6\n\n\nDoug Hoyte's submission\n to the 2017 underhanded solidity contest received \nan honorable mention\n. The entry is interesting, because it raises the concerns about how C-like underflow might affect Solidity storage.

However, since dynamic arrays are stored sequentially, if a malicious actor wanted to change \nmanipulateMe\n all they would need to do is:\n\n\n\n\nCall \npopBonusCode\n to underflow (Note: \narray.pop()\n method \nwas added\n in Solidity 0.5.0)\n\n\nCompute the storage location of \nmanipulateMe\n\n\nModify and update \nmanipulateMe\n's value using \nmodifyBonusCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn practice, this array would be immediately pointed out as fishy, but buried under more complex smart contract architecture, it can arbitrarily allow malicious changes to constant variables, such as total supply of a token.\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering use of a dynamic array, a container data scructure is a good practice. The Solidity CRUD \npart 1\n and \npart 2\n articles are good resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoS with (Unexpected) revert\n\u00b6\n\n\nConsider a simple auction contract:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\ncontract\n \nAuction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \ncurrentLeader\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n>\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nrequire\n(\ncurrentLeader\n.\nsend\n(\nhighestBid\n));\n \n// Refund the old leader, if it fails then revert\n\n\n        \ncurrentLeader\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n        \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf attacker bids using a smart contract which has a fallback function that reverts any payment, the attacker can win any auction. When it tries to refund the old leader, it reverts if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will \nalways\n fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the \nbid()\n function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a \npull payment system\n instead, as described earlier.\n\n\nAnother example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.\n\n\naddress\n[]\n \nprivate\n \nrefundAddresses\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \npublic\n \nrefunds\n;\n\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n \nrefundAll\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nfor\n(\nuint\n \nx\n;\n \nx\n \n<\n \nrefundAddresses\n.\nlength\n;\n \nx\n++\n)\n \n{\n \n// arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nrefundAddresses\n[\nx\n].\nsend\n(\nrefunds\n[\nrefundAddresses\n[\nx\n]]))\n \n// doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the recommended solution is to \nfavor pull over push payments\n.\n\n\n\n\nDoS with Block Gas Limit\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach block has an upper bound on the amount of gas that can be spent, and thus the amount computation that can be done. This is the Block Gas Limit. If the gas spent exceeds this limit, the transaction will fail. This leads to a couple possible Denial of Service vectors:\n\n\nGas Limit DoS on a Contract via Unbounded Operations\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit.\n\n\nThis can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.\n\n\nThis is another reason to \nfavor pull over push payments\n.\n\n\nIf you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:\n\n\nstruct\n \nPayee\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \naddr\n;\n\n    \nuint256\n \nvalue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nPayee\n[]\n \npayees\n;\n\n\nuint256\n \nnextPayeeIndex\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \npayOut\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nuint256\n \ni\n \n=\n \nnextPayeeIndex\n;\n\n    \nwhile\n \n(\ni\n \n<\n \npayees\n.\nlength\n \n&&\n \nmsg\n.\ngas\n \n>\n \n200000\n)\n \n{\n\n      \npayees\n[\ni\n].\naddr\n.\nsend\n(\npayees\n[\ni\n].\nvalue\n);\n\n      \ni\n++\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nnextPayeeIndex\n \n=\n \ni\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the \npayOut()\n function. So only use this pattern if absolutely necessary.\n\n\nGas Limit DoS on the Network via Block Stuffing\n\u00b6\n\n\nEven if your contract does not contain an unbounded loop, an attacker can prevent other transactions from being included in the blockchain for several blocks by placing computationally intensive transactions with a high enough gas price.\n\n\nTo do this, the attacker can issue several transactions which will consume the entire gas limit, with a high enough gas price to be included as soon as the next block is mined. No gas price can guarantee inclusion in the block, but the higher the price is, the higher is the chance.\n\n\nIf the attack succeeds, no other transactions will be included in the block. Sometimes, an attacker's goal is to block transactions to a specific contract prior to specific time.\n\n\nThis attack \nwas conducted\n on Fomo3D, a gambling app. The app was designed to reward the last address that purchased a \"key\". Each key purchase extended the timer, and the game ended once the timer went to 0. The attacker bought a key and then stuffed 13 blocks in a row until the timer was triggered and the payout was released. Transactions sent by attacker took 7.9 million gas on each block, so the gas limit allowed a few small \"send\" transactions (which take 21,000 gas each), but disallowed any calls to the \nbuyKey()\n function (which costs 300,000+ gas).\n\n\nA Block Stuffing attack can be used on any contract requiring an action within a certain time period. However, as with any attack, it is only profitable when the expected reward exceeds its cost. Cost of this attack is directly proportional to the number of blocks which need to be stuffed. If a large payout can be obtained by preventing actions from other participants, your contract will likely be targeted by such an attack.\n\n\n\n\nInsufficient gas griefing\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis attack may be possible on a contract which accepts generic data and uses it to make a call another contract (a 'sub-call') via the low level \naddress.call()\n function, as is often the case with multisignature and transaction relayer contracts.\n\n\nIf the call fails, the contract has two options:\n\n\n\n\nrevert the whole transaction\n\n\ncontinue execution.\n\n\n\n\nTake the following example of a simplified \nRelayer\n contract which continues execution regardless of the outcome of the subcall:\n\n\ncontract\n \nRelayer\n \n{\n\n    \nmapping\n \n(\nbytes\n \n=>\n \nbool\n)\n \nexecuted\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nrelay\n(\nbytes\n \n_data\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \n// replay protection; do not call the same transaction twice\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nexecuted\n[\n_data\n]\n \n==\n \n0\n,\n \n\"Duplicate call\"\n);\n\n        \nexecuted\n[\n_data\n]\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n        \ninnerContract\n.\ncall\n(\nbytes4\n(\nkeccak256\n(\n\"execute(bytes)\"\n)),\n \n_data\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contract allows transaction relaying. Someone who wants to make a transaction but can't execute it by himself (e.g. due to the lack of ether to pay for gas) can sign data that he wants to pass and transfer the data with his signature over any medium. A third party \"forwarder\" can then submit this transaction to the network on behalf of the user.\n\n\nIf given just the right amount of gas, the \nRelayer\n would complete execution recording the \n_data\nargument in the \nexecuted\n mapping, but the subcall would fail because it received insufficient gas to complete execution.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen a contract makes a sub-call to another contract, the EVM limits the gas forwarded to \nto 63/64 of the remaining gas\n,\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can use this to censor transactions, causing them to fail by sending them with a low amount of gas. This attack is a form of \"\ngriefing\n\": It doesn't directly benefit the attacker, but causes grief for the victim. A dedicated attacker, willing to consistently spend a small amount of gas could theoretically censor all transactions this way, if they were the first to submit them to \nRelayer\n.\n\n\nOne way to address this is to implement logic requiring forwarders to provide enough gas to finish the subcall. If the miner tried to conduct the attack in this scenario, the \nrequire\n statement would fail and the inner call would revert. A user can specify a minimum gasLimit along with the other data (in this example, typically the \n_gasLimit\n value would be verified by a signature, but that is ommitted for simplicity in this case).\n\n\n// contract called by Relayer\n\n\ncontract\n \nExecutor\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \nexecute\n(\nbytes\n \n_data\n,\n \nuint\n \n_gasLimit\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\ngasleft\n()\n \n>=\n \n_gasLimit\n);\n\n        \n...\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother solution is to permit only trusted accounts to relay the transaction.\n\n\n\n\nForcibly Sending Ether to a Contract\n\u00b6\n\n\nIt is possible to forcibly send Ether to a contract without triggering its fallback function. This is an important consideration when placing important logic in the fallback function or making calculations based on a contract's balance. Take the following example:\n\n\ncontract\n \nVulnerable\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrevert\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsomethingBad\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nthis\n.\nbalance\n \n>\n \n0\n);\n\n        \n// Do something bad\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nContract logic seems to disallow payments to the contract and therefore disallow \"something bad\" from happening. However, a few methods exist for forcibly sending ether to the contract and therefore making its balance greater than zero.\n\n\nThe \nselfdestruct\n contract method allows a user to specify a beneficiary to send any excess ether. \nselfdestruct\n \ndoes not trigger a contract's fallback function\n.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIt is also possible to \nprecompute\n a contract's address and send Ether to that address before deploying the contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeprecated/historical attacks\n\u00b6\n\n\nThese are attacks which are no longer possible due to changes in the protocol or improvements to solidity. They are recorded here for posterity and awareness.\n\n\nCall Depth Attack (deprecated)\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs of the \nEIP 150\n hardfork, call depth attacks are no longer relevant\n*\n (all gas would be consumed well before reaching the 1024 call depth limit).\n\n\nConstantinople Reentrancy Attack\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn January 16\nth\n, 2019, Constantinople protocol upgrade was delayed due to a security vulnerability enabled by \nEIP 1283\n. \nEIP 1283: Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps\n proposes changes to reduce excessive gas costs on dirty storage writes.\n\n\nThis change led to possibility of a new reentrancy vector making previously known secure withdrawal patterns (\n.send()\n and \n.transfer()\n) unsafe in specific situations\n*\n, where the attacker could hijack the control flow and use the remaining gas enabled by EIP 1283, leading to vulnerabilities due to reentrancy.\n\n\nOther Vulnerabilities\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \nSmart Contract Weakness Classification Registry\n offers a complete and up-to-date catalogue of known smart contract vulnerabilities and anti-patterns along with real-world examples.

Its goal is to codify the rules and decisionmaking apparatus of an organization, eliminating the need for documents and people in governing, creating a structure with decentralized control.

This resulted in Ethereum being forked into Ethereum Classic and Ethereum.   In the example given, the best way to prevent this attack is to make sure you don't call an external function until you've done all the internal work you need to do:  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   private   userBalances ;  function   withdrawBalance ()   public   { \n     uint   amountToWithdraw   =   userBalances [ msg . sender ]; \n     userBalances [ msg . sender ]   =   0 ; \n     ( bool   success ,   )   =   msg . sender . call . value ( amountToWithdraw )( \"\" );   // The user's balance is already 0, so future invocations won't withdraw anything \n     require ( success );  }   Note that if you had another function which called  withdrawBalance() , it would be potentially subject to the same attack, so you must treat any function which calls an untrusted contract as itself untrusted.

            "text": "Since reentrancy can occur across multiple functions, and even multiple contracts, any solution aimed at preventing reentrancy with a single function will not be sufficient.  Instead,  we have recommended finishing all internal work (ie. state changes) first, and only then calling the external function . This rule, if followed carefully, will allow you to avoid vulnerabilities due to reentrancy. However, you need to not only avoid calling external functions too soon, but also avoid calling functions which call external functions. For example, the following is insecure:  // INSECURE  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   private   userBalances ;  mapping   ( address   =>   bool )   private   claimedBonus ;  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   private   rewardsForA ;  function   withdrawReward ( address   recipient )   public   { \n     uint   amountToWithdraw   =   rewardsForA [ recipient ]; \n     rewardsForA [ recipient ]   =   0 ; \n     ( bool   success ,   )   =   recipient . call . value ( amountToWithdraw )( \"\" ); \n     require ( success );  }  function   getFirstWithdrawalBonus ( address   recipient )   public   { \n     require ( ! claimedBonus [ recipient ]);   // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once \n\n     rewardsForA [ recipient ]   +=   100 ; \n     withdrawReward ( recipient );   // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again. \n     claimedBonus [ recipient ]   =   true ;  }   Even though  getFirstWithdrawalBonus()  doesn't directly call an external contract, the call in  withdrawReward()  is enough to make it vulnerable to a reentrancy. You therefore need to treat  withdrawReward()  as if it were also untrusted.  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   private   userBalances ;  mapping   ( address   =>   bool )   private   claimedBonus ;  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   private   rewardsForA ;  function   untrustedWithdrawReward ( address   recipient )   public   { \n     uint   amountToWithdraw   =   rewardsForA [ recipient ]; \n     rewardsForA [ recipient ]   =   0 ; \n     ( bool   success ,   )   =   recipient . call . value ( amountToWithdraw )( \"\" ); \n     require ( success );  }  function   untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus ( address   recipient )   public   { \n     require ( ! claimedBonus [ recipient ]);   // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once \n\n     claimedBonus [ recipient ]   =   true ; \n     rewardsForA [ recipient ]   +=   100 ; \n     untrustedWithdrawReward ( recipient );   // claimedBonus has been set to true, so reentry is impossible  }   In addition to the fix making reentry impossible,  untrusted functions have been marked . This same pattern repeats at every level: since  untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()  calls  untrustedWithdrawReward() , which calls an external contract, you must also treat  untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()  as insecure.  Another solution often suggested is a  mutex . This allows you to \"lock\" some state so it can only be changed by the owner of the lock. A simple example might look like this:  // Note: This is a rudimentary example, and mutexes are particularly useful where there is substantial logic and/or shared state  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   private   balances ;  bool   private   lockBalances ;  function   deposit ()   payable   public   returns   ( bool )   { \n     require ( ! lockBalances ); \n     lockBalances   =   true ; \n     balances [ msg . sender ]   +=   msg . value ; \n     lockBalances   =   false ; \n     return   true ;  }  function   withdraw ( uint   amount )   payable   public   returns   ( bool )   { \n     require ( ! lockBalances   &&   amount   >   0   &&   balances [ msg . sender ]   >=   amount ); \n     lockBalances   =   true ; \n\n     ( bool   success ,   )   =   msg . sender . call ( amount )( \"\" ); \n\n     if   ( success )   {   // Normally insecure, but the mutex saves it \n       balances [ msg . sender ]   -=   amount ; \n     } \n\n     lockBalances   =   false ; \n     return   true ;  }   If the user tries to call  withdraw()  again before the first call finishes, the lock will prevent it from having any effect. This can be an effective pattern, but it gets tricky when you have multiple contracts that need to cooperate. The following is insecure:  // INSECURE  contract   StateHolder   { \n     uint   private   n ; \n     address   private   lockHolder ; \n\n     function   getLock ()   { \n         require ( lockHolder   ==   address ( 0 )); \n         lockHolder   =   msg . sender ; \n     } \n\n     function   releaseLock ()   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   lockHolder ); \n         lockHolder   =   address ( 0 ); \n     } \n\n     function   set ( uint   newState )   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   lockHolder ); \n         n   =   newState ; \n     }  }   An attacker can call  getLock() , and then never call  releaseLock() . If they do this, then the contract will be locked forever, and no further changes will be able to be made. If you use mutexes to protect against reentrancy, you will need to carefully ensure that there are no ways for a lock to be claimed and never released. (There are other potential dangers when programming with mutexes, such as deadlocks and livelocks. You should consult the large amount of literature already written on mutexes, if you decide to go this route.)",

Another example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.  address []   private   refundAddresses ;  mapping   ( address   =>   uint )   public   refunds ;  // bad  function   refundAll ()   public   { \n     for ( uint   x ;   x   <   refundAddresses . length ;   x ++ )   {   // arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated \n         require ( refundAddresses [ x ]. send ( refunds [ refundAddresses [ x ]]))   // doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds \n     }  }   Again, the recommended solution is to  favor pull over push payments .",

            "text": "You may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit.  This can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.  This is another reason to  favor pull over push payments .  If you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:  struct   Payee   { \n     address   addr ; \n     uint256   value ;  }  Payee []   payees ;  uint256   nextPayeeIndex ;  function   payOut ()   { \n     uint256   i   =   nextPayeeIndex ; \n     while   ( i   <   payees . length   &&   msg . gas   >   200000 )   { \n       payees [ i ]. addr . send ( payees [ i ]. value ); \n       i ++ ; \n     } \n     nextPayeeIndex   =   i ;  }   You will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the  payOut()  function.

            "text": "Even if your contract does not contain an unbounded loop, an attacker can prevent other transactions from being included in the blockchain for several blocks by placing computationally intensive transactions with a high enough gas price.  To do this, the attacker can issue several transactions which will consume the entire gas limit, with a high enough gas price to be included as soon as the next block is mined. No gas price can guarantee inclusion in the block, but the higher the price is, the higher is the chance.  If the attack succeeds, no other transactions will be included in the block. Sometimes, an attacker's goal is to block transactions to a specific contract prior to specific time.  This attack  was conducted  on Fomo3D, a gambling app. The app was designed to reward the last address that purchased a \"key\". Each key purchase extended the timer, and the game ended once the timer went to 0. The attacker bought a key and then stuffed 13 blocks in a row until the timer was triggered and the payout was released. Transactions sent by attacker took 7.9 million gas on each block, so the gas limit allowed a few small \"send\" transactions (which take 21,000 gas each), but disallowed any calls to the  buyKey()  function (which costs 300,000+ gas).  A Block Stuffing attack can be used on any contract requiring an action within a certain time period. However, as with any attack, it is only profitable when the expected reward exceeds its cost. Cost of this attack is directly proportional to the number of blocks which need to be stuffed. If a large payout can be obtained by preventing actions from other participants, your contract will likely be targeted by such an attack.",

            "text": "This attack may be possible on a contract which accepts generic data and uses it to make a call another contract (a 'sub-call') via the low level  address.call()  function, as is often the case with multisignature and transaction relayer contracts.  If the call fails, the contract has two options:   revert the whole transaction  continue execution.   Take the following example of a simplified  Relayer  contract which continues execution regardless of the outcome of the subcall:  contract   Relayer   { \n     mapping   ( bytes   =>   bool )   executed ; \n\n     function   relay ( bytes   _data )   public   { \n         // replay protection; do not call the same transaction twice \n         require ( executed [ _data ]   ==   0 ,   \"Duplicate call\" ); \n         executed [ _data ]   =   true ; \n         innerContract . call ( bytes4 ( keccak256 ( \"execute(bytes)\" )),   _data ); \n     }  }   This contract allows transaction relaying. Someone who wants to make a transaction but can't execute it by himself (e.g. due to the lack of ether to pay for gas) can sign data that he wants to pass and transfer the data with his signature over any medium. A third party \"forwarder\" can then submit this transaction to the network on behalf of the user.  If given just the right amount of gas, the  Relayer  would complete execution recording the  _data argument in the  executed  mapping, but the subcall would fail because it received insufficient gas to complete execution.   Note  When a contract makes a sub-call to another contract, the EVM limits the gas forwarded to  to 63/64 of the remaining gas ,   An attacker can use this to censor transactions, causing them to fail by sending them with a low amount of gas. This attack is a form of \" griefing \": It doesn't directly benefit the attacker, but causes grief for the victim. A dedicated attacker, willing to consistently spend a small amount of gas could theoretically censor all transactions this way, if they were the first to submit them to  Relayer .  One way to address this is to implement logic requiring forwarders to provide enough gas to finish the subcall. If the miner tried to conduct the attack in this scenario, the  require  statement would fail and the inner call would revert. A user can specify a minimum gasLimit along with the other data (in this example, typically the  _gasLimit  value would be verified by a signature, but that is ommitted for simplicity in this case).  // contract called by Relayer  contract   Executor   { \n     function   execute ( bytes   _data ,   uint   _gasLimit )   { \n         require ( gasleft ()   >=   _gasLimit ); \n         ... \n     }  }   Another solution is to permit only trusted accounts to relay the transaction.",

Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.\n\n\nThe approach we advocate is to \"prepare for failure\". It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage. This section presents a variety of techniques that will help you prepare for failure.\n\n\nNote: There's always a risk when you add a new component to your system. A badly designed fail-safe could itself become a vulnerability - as can the interaction between a number of well designed fail-safes.

You must be extremely careful with how you store data in this contract. If your new contract has a different storage layout than the first, your data may end up corrupted. Additionally, this simple version of the pattern cannot return values from functions, only forward them, which limits its applicability. (\nMore complex implementations\n attempt to solve this with in-line assembly code and a registry of return sizes.)\n\n\nRegardless of your approach, it is important to have some way to upgrade your contracts, or they will become unusable when the inevitable bugs are discovered in them.\n\n\nCircuit Breakers (Pause contract functionality)\n\u00b6\n\n\nCircuit breakers stop execution if certain conditions are met, and can be useful when new errors are discovered. For example, most actions may be suspended in a contract if a bug is discovered, and the only action now active is a withdrawal. You can either give certain trusted parties the ability to trigger the circuit breaker or else have programmatic rules that automatically trigger the certain breaker when certain conditions are met.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nbool\n \nprivate\n \nstopped\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n\naddress\n \nprivate\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n\nmodifier\n \nisAdmin\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n);\n\n    \n_\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ntoggleContractActive\n()\n \nisAdmin\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// You can add an additional modifier that restricts stopping a contract to be based on another action, such as a vote of users\n\n    \nstopped\n \n=\n \n!\nstopped\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodifier\n \nstopInEmergency\n \n{\n \nif\n \n(\n!\nstopped\n)\n \n_\n;\n \n}\n\n\nmodifier\n \nonlyInEmergency\n \n{\n \nif\n \n(\nstopped\n)\n \n_\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \nstopInEmergency\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// some code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n()\n \nonlyInEmergency\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// some code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Bumps (Delay contract actions)\n\u00b6\n\n\nSpeed bumps slow down actions, so that if malicious actions occur, there is time to recover. For example, \nThe DAO\n required 27 days between a successful request to split the DAO and the ability to do so. This ensured the funds were kept within the contract, increasing the likelihood of recovery. In the case of the DAO, there was no effective action that could be taken during the time given by the speed bump, but in combination with our other techniques, they can be quite effective.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nstruct\n \nRequestedWithdrawal\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namount\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \ntime\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nbalances\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=>\n \nRequestedWithdrawal\n)\n \nprivate\n \nrequestedWithdrawals\n;\n\n\nuint\n \nconstant\n \nwithdrawalWaitPeriod\n \n=\n \n28\n \ndays\n;\n \n// 4 weeks\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nrequestWithdrawal\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n>\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n        \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \n// for simplicity, we withdraw everything;\n\n        \n// presumably, the deposit function prevents new deposits when withdrawals are in progress\n\n\n        \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \nRequestedWithdrawal\n({\n\n            \namount\n:\n \namountToWithdraw\n,\n\n            \ntime\n:\n \nnow\n\n        \n});\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n(\nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\namount\n \n>\n \n0\n \n&&\n \nnow\n \n>\n \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\ntime\n \n+\n \nwithdrawalWaitPeriod\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\namount\n;\n\n        \nrequestedWithdrawals\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n].\namount\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\nsend\n(\namountToWithdraw\n));\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Limiting\n\u00b6\n\n\nRate limiting halts or requires approval for substantial changes.

Example 1: Use a registry contract to store latest version of a contract  In this example, the calls aren't forwarded, so users should fetch the current address each time before interacting with it.  contract   SomeRegister   { \n     address   backendContract ; \n     address []   previousBackends ; \n     address   owner ; \n\n     function   SomeRegister ()   { \n         owner   =   msg . sender ; \n     } \n\n     modifier   onlyOwner ()   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   owner ) \n         _ ; \n     } \n\n     function   changeBackend ( address   newBackend )   public \n     onlyOwner () \n     returns   ( bool ) \n     { \n         if ( newBackend   !=   backendContract )   { \n             previousBackends . push ( backendContract ); \n             backendContract   =   newBackend ; \n             return   true ; \n         } \n\n         return   false ; \n     }  }   There are two main disadvantages to this approach:   Users must always look up the current address, and anyone who fails to do so risks using an old version of the contract  You will need to think carefully about how to deal with the contract data when you replace the contract   The alternate approach is to have a contract forward calls and data to the latest version of the contract:  Example 2:  Use a  DELEGATECALL  to forward data and calls  contract   Relay   { \n     address   public   currentVersion ; \n     address   public   owner ; \n\n     modifier   onlyOwner ()   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   owner ); \n         _ ; \n     } \n\n     function   Relay ( address   initAddr )   { \n         currentVersion   =   initAddr ; \n         owner   =   msg . sender ;   // this owner may be another contract with multisig, not a single contract owner \n     } \n\n     function   changeContract ( address   newVersion )   public \n     onlyOwner () \n     { \n         currentVersion   =   newVersion ; \n     } \n\n     function ()   { \n         require ( currentVersion . delegatecall ( msg . data )); \n     }  }   This approach avoids the previous problems but has problems of its own. You must be extremely careful with how you store data in this contract. If your new contract has a different storage layout than the first, your data may end up corrupted. Additionally, this simple version of the pattern cannot return values from functions, only forward them, which limits its applicability. ( More complex implementations  attempt to solve this with in-line assembly code and a registry of return sizes.)  Regardless of your approach, it is important to have some way to upgrade your contracts, or they will become unusable when the inevitable bugs are discovered in them.",

For example, most actions may be suspended in a contract if a bug is discovered, and the only action now active is a withdrawal. You can either give certain trusted parties the ability to trigger the circuit breaker or else have programmatic rules that automatically trigger the certain breaker when certain conditions are met.  Example:  bool   private   stopped   =   false ;  address   private   owner ;  modifier   isAdmin ()   { \n     require ( msg . sender   ==   owner ); \n     _ ;  }  function   toggleContractActive ()   isAdmin   public   { \n     // You can add an additional modifier that restricts stopping a contract to be based on another action, such as a vote of users \n     stopped   =   ! stopped ;  }  modifier   stopInEmergency   {   if   ( ! stopped )   _ ;   }  modifier   onlyInEmergency   {   if   ( stopped )   _ ;   }  function   deposit ()   stopInEmergency   public   { \n     // some code  }  function   withdraw ()   onlyInEmergency   public   { \n     // some code  }",

Keep bounty participants informed throughout the process, and then strive to avoid delays in sending them their reward   For an example of the three tiers of rewards, see  Ethereum's Bounty Program :   The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on severity of impact. Rewards for minor 'harmless' bugs start at 0.05 BTC. Major bugs, for example leading to consensus issues, will be rewarded up to 5 BTC. Much higher rewards are possible (up to 25 BTC) in case of very severe vulnerabilities.",
